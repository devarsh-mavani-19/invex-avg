              Moderna is a young growth company it has potential to grow more in
              the upcoming years because of its research. As predicted by the 17
              analyst the mean sales growth is estimated as 20.1B and 18.5B for
              the year 2021 and 2022 respectively. The high sales estimation is
              22B and 36.6B & the low sales estimation is 16.9b and 10.2B for
              the year 2021 and 2022 respectively. Because of covid vaccine
              analyst are predicting high growth in the revenue. Moderna just
              got profitable in this quarture and has manage make margin of
              68%.before it was loss making company. The margin of the
              comparable firm like Pfizer generally between 25% to 30%. Bank of
              America analyst Geoff Meacham wrote in a note published that the
              current valuation remains “unreasonable.” In order to justify the
              market capitalization, an investor would need to assume that the
              company would sell up to 1.5 billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine
              each year, and a 100% probability of success for the entire
              pipeline with aggregate peak sales of $30 billion. Keeping
              optimistic view, after the surge in the revenue in 2022, we kept
              the revenue grow at the Risk Free Rate for the entire year same
              for the next 10 years.
